# Discord Clock

</div>

A Simple Discord Bot That Made Out Of Discord.js And moment.js :)


## Get Started
Requirements:
1. [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) **v12** or higher LTS version;
2. [**Your Discord bot's token**](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/);
3. _your time, of course_ ;).

Installation:
1. Clone or download this repo;
2. Open up your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repo's directory that you've cloned;
3. Run `npm install`.

Configuration:
Open `config.js` file with your favorite text editor and change all required fields.

Run:
1. Open your terminal or command prompt or whatever it is called, navigate (`cd`) to the cloned repo;
2. Run `node index.js` or `npm start`;
3. Well, technically you're done!.

# Note
> The clock is updated every 10 minutes, so **it is not up-to-date**. Because Discord is now __ratelimiting__ us for _10 minutes_ to change the channel's name!
